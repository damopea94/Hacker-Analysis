    "Hacker News is where clients can submit posts that are decided on and remarked upon by different clients. I will concentrate on two sorts of posts from Hacker News: Ask HN and Show HN. Ask HN are posts that ask the Hacker News people group explicit inquiries while Show HN entries show client tasks to the network. The top Hacker News posts which have the most remarks can get a huge number of guests to their locales. In this undertaking, I will break down an informational collection (https://www.kaggle.com/programmer news/programmer news-posts) from Kaggle to decide if Ask HN or Show HN posts get more remarks overall. The informational collection has been diminished from ~3000,000 lines to ~20,000 pushes by expelling all entries which didn't get any remarks."
